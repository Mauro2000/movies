At its best, it delivers moments of optic greatness (a lightning strike-illuminating barn scene stands out), but most of the film is bleak and droll, full of a muddled script and lackluster performances.";}i:2;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"40";s:3:"url";s:58:"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-reckoning/";s:9:"publisher";s:6:"Empire";s:6:"author";s:9:"Ian Freer";s:6:"review";s:270:"Neil Marshall’s return to his homegrown horror wheelhouse doesn’t reach the heights of Dog Soldiers and The Descent. Instead, it’s a witch-hunt thriller that lacks the texture to be realistic and the no-holds-barred energy to be pulpy. Sean Pertwee has fun though.";}i:3;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"40";s:3:"url";s:96:"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/reckoning-review-hollywood-allegations-recast-english-witch/";s:9:"publisher";s:13:"The Telegraph";s:6:"author";s:9:"Tim Robey";s:6:"review";s:208:"Despite a spirited score and a few other redeeming features, The Reckoning is too clumsy, overlong and generally miscalculated to add up to an intelligent commentary on misogyny, or a satisfying riposte to it";}i:4;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"38";s:3:"url";s:95:"https://rogersmovienation.com/2021/02/01/movie-review-plague-and-witches-meet-in-the-reckoning/";s:9:"publisher";s:12:"Movie Nation";s:6:"author";s:11:"Roger Moore";s:6:"review";s:207:"The whole tedious affair makes one wish they’d gone to less trouble making a bad movie with tame villains, an uninteresting lead and confused (Was this recut to play up “the plague?”), scattered story.";}i:5;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"25";s:3:"url";s:66:"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-reckoning-movie-review-2021";s:9:"publisher";s:14:"RogerEbert.com";s:6:"author";s:12:"Simon Abrams";s:6:"review";s:118:"The ensemble cast members all dutifully perform their roles, but there’s not much for them to sink their teeth into.";}i:6;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"20";s:3:"url";s:119:"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/14/the-reckoning-review-witch-movie-descends-into-misogynistic-torture-ordeal";s:9:"publisher";s:12:"The Guardian";s:6:"author";s:11:"Cath Clarke";s:6:"review";s:51:"The film left me shaking with anger more than fear.";}}
