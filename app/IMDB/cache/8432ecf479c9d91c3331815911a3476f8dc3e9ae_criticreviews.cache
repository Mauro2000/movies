It’s funny on both age levels.";}i:2;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"80";s:3:"url";s:97:"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/minions-rise-gru-review-brilliant-breakneck-throwback-looney/";s:9:"publisher";s:13:"The Telegraph";s:6:"author";s:13:"Robbie Collin";s:6:"review";s:375:"The animation is technically wondrous – the colour and detail amazes, while the Minions themselves have never looked more bouncily robust – but it’s always in service of the overriding slapstick agenda. Even the flat, side-on compositions – less than ideal for showing off graphical prowess – feel like knowing evocations of the deadpan staging of vintage cartoons.";}i:3;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"75";s:3:"url";s:88:"https://www.avclub.com/minions-rise-gru-review-steve-carell-rza-taraji-henson-1849108874";s:9:"publisher";s:13:"The A.V. Club";s:6:"author";s:14:"Todd Gilchrist";s:6:"review";s:242:"Ultimately, The Rise Of Gru exerts a negligible impact on the Minions’ canonical journey. If nothing else, the film serves as a reminder of the characters’ cartoonish charms, both literally and thematically, and their transcendent appeal.";}i:4;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"75";s:3:"url";s:3:"n/A";s:9:"publisher";s:17:"The Seattle Times";s:6:"author";s:14:"Soren Andersen";s:6:"review";s:212:"Kids will love all the silliness, but oddly the greatest resonance of the Wayback Machine plot will be felt by the kids’ grandparents (if any find themselves in attendance) who were around in those bygone days.";}i:5;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"70";s:3:"url";s:80:"https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/minions-the-rise-of-gru-review-1235293045/";s:9:"publisher";s:7:"Variety";s:6:"author";s:13:"Peter Debruge";s:6:"review";s:186:"Six months into 2022, it’s the funniest film Hollywood has produced thus far. Audiences know what to expect, and Illumination delivers, offering another feel-good dose of bad behavior.";}i:6;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"63";s:3:"url";s:86:"https://www.washingtonpost.com/movies/2022/06/28/minions-the-rise-of-gru-movie-review/";s:9:"publisher";s:15:"Washington Post";s:6:"author";s:3:"n/A";s:6:"review";s:267:"Although the humor doesn’t wear out its welcome, the whiz-bang action sequences do, especially when the unnecessarily bombastic, San Francisco-set finale arrives.
