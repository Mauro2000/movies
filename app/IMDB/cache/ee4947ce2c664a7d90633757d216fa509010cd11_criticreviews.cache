Smartly scary and scary smart, consistent with the history of this series but unafraid to piss off fans if it’s for the good of the story. This satire of requels may very well be the first requel done right. It’s a scream, baby.";}i:1;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"90";s:3:"url";s:3:"n/A";s:9:"publisher";s:3:"IGN";s:6:"author";s:16:"Amelia Emberwing";s:6:"review";s:331:"The latest addition to the Scream franchise expertly blends reverence for the source material while creating something that feels almost completely new. All of the performances are pitch-perfect as the new generation of Woodsboro teens step into their futures, the kills are gnarly, and no version of toxic fandom is left unmocked.";}i:2;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"80";s:3:"url";s:56:"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/scream-2022/";s:9:"publisher";s:6:"Empire";s:6:"author";s:10:"Ben Travis";s:6:"review";s:171:"For the most part, this is a ‘re-quel’ as fast, funny and ferocious as a Scream movie should be. In an era of elevated horror, it’s a gloriously gory basement party.";}i:3;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"80";s:3:"url";s:43:"https://www.gamesradar.com/scream-5-review/";s:9:"publisher";s:10:"Total Film";s:6:"author";s:12:"Jamie Graham";s:6:"review";s:179:"The stalk ‘n’ slash sequences, though decent, can’t match Craven’s mastery of mood and mechanics, but the new guys understand that Scream movies are sick as well as slick.";}i:4;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"75";s:3:"url";s:129:"https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/review-cox-arquette-campbell-return-to-critique-sequels-in-cleverly-crafted-new-scream";s:9:"publisher";s:23:"San Francisco Chronicle";s:6:"author";s:10:"Zaki Hasan";s:6:"review";s:364:"In addition to being the best of the sequels (with all the jumps, gore and quips we’ve come to expect), the new Scream is very much a movie for this moment, tapping into the vogue for legacy revisitations, and its own privileged status as an elder statesman on the horror scene, to show how the familiar can feel both comfortable and terrifying at the same time.";}i:5;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"70";s:3:"url";s:106:"https://variety.com/2022/film/reviews/scream-review-neve-campbell-david-arquette-courteney-cox-1235151125/";s:9:"publisher";s:7:"Variety";s:6:"author";s:15:"Owen Gleiberman";s:6:"review";s:305:"The new Scream is about as good as “Scream 2” was — it keeps the thrill of the original “Scream” bouncing in the air like a blood-drenched balloon — but the film is basically a set of variations on a very old sleight-of-hand fear blueprint. Except that it’s now old enough to seem new again.";}i:6;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"67";s:3:"url";s:89:"https://www.avclub.com/a-new-generation-takes-a-stab-at-scream-in-the-first-se-1848340926";s:9:"publisher";s:13:"The A.V. Club";s:6:"author";s:10:"Katie Rife";s:6:"review";s:260:"The script, from veteran screenwriter James Vanderbilt and Castle Rock scribe Guy Busick, leans in to the franchise’s fidgety intelligence, swerving and ducking and winking at the camera like the “meta whodunit slasher” it proudly proclaims itself to be.";}i:7;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"60";s:3:"url";s:114:"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/12/scream-review-irony-laden-horror-requel-is-starting-to-creak-with-age";s:9:"publisher";s:12:"The Guardian";s:6:"author";s:14:"Peter Bradshaw";s:6:"review";s:295:"Perhaps there is less zap in Scream nowadays and archly invoking the newer generation of indie horror - Jordan Peele is mentioned, with absolute respect - only serves in the long run to remind you how elderly Scream is. But it’s still capable of delivering some piercing high-pitched decibels.";}i:8;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"50";s:3:"url";s:92:"https://nypost.com/2022/01/12/scream-movie-review-slasher-rehash-is-less-scary-than-midtown/";s:9:"publisher";s:13:"New York Post";s:6:"author";s:17:"Johnny Oleksinski";s:6:"review";s:252:"Should a serial killer blood-bath be so comfy and nostalgic for an audience? Not if it wants to maintain our interest. Over two hours, Cinco de Scream-o lumbers along with routine kills and few surprises even when it makes lame attempts at shocking us.";}i:9;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"50";s:3:"url";s:85:"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/scream-film-review-1235073697/";s:9:"publisher";s:22:"The Hollywood Reporter";s:6:"author";s:12:"David Rooney";s:6:"review";s:225:"Sure, there’s some fun in all that meta-playfulness. But there’s also a facetiousness that wears thin and intrudes on the killing spree, making me often wish I was watching any one of the superior movies being referenced.";}}
