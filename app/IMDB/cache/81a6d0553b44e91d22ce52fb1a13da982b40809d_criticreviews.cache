It’s Back to the Future meets The Last Starfighter with a slew of wonderful performances from a cast that clearly loves the concept as much as I do. Ryan Reynolds is on top form as Adam, while Walker Scobell matches him punch for punch with a great debut performance.";}i:1;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"77";s:3:"url";s:3:"n/A";s:9:"publisher";s:4:"CNET";s:6:"author";s:16:"Richard Trenholm";s:6:"review";s:164:"Ryan Reynolds stars as a wisecracking time-flyer in Netflix's breezy but heartfelt version of ET, Back to the Future and Flight of the Navigator for the Marvel era.";}i:2;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"75";s:3:"url";s:123:"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/3/9/22969010/adam-project-review-netflix-ryan-reynolds-movie-walker-scobell";s:9:"publisher";s:17:"Chicago Sun-Times";s:6:"author";s:14:"Richard Roeper";s:6:"review";s:225:"With echoes of “Back to the Future,” “The Terminator” and even a little of “Heaven Can Wait,” this is a consistently entertaining comedy-actioner with a lot of heart — and the perfect ending.
