Jupiter Ascending doesn’t break the new ground that the Wachowskis have managed in the past...but the film never slacks in its efforts to wow us.";}i:1;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"83";s:3:"url";s:33:"https://uproxx.com/entertainment/";s:9:"publisher";s:6:"Hitfix";s:6:"author";s:12:"Drew McWeeny";s:6:"review";s:205:"Fast, frequently teetering on the cusp of the ridiculous, and eye-poppingly pretty, Jupiter Ascending is a wicked slice of entertainment, and a heck of an antidote to the typical February box-office blahs.";}i:2;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"80";s:3:"url";s:52:"https://www.gamesradar.com/jupiter-ascending-review/";s:9:"publisher";s:10:"Total Film";s:6:"author";s:3:"n/A";s:6:"review";s:117:"Both visually and in the action stakes, Jupiter Ascending could give pretty much any space movie a run for its money.";}i:3;a:5:{s:6:"rating";s:2:"60";s:3:"url";s:3:"n/A";s:9:"publisher";s:15:"Time Out London";s:6:"author";s:14:"Tom Huddleston";s:6:"review";s:214:"This is one mad mess from start to finish...
